# This file contains a table of all supported GD32 microcontrollers.
#
# It lists them by family (which corresponds to a crate),
# then by the "device" in that family (corresponds to an SVD file,
# and to a module within each crate).
#
# For each device, there is a link to the product page and reference manual,
# the reference manual ID, the title from the reference manual,
# and a list of actual members of this family (without size/package codes).
#
# This data is used to generate more informative crate READMEs.
